When, he far exceeded the programming course in a very little commercial language, the assembly language that provided a deep knowledge of computers. He work on the IBM 360/370 system of those years, Digital Research's PDP 11, All mainframes and microprocessors arrived, for which he was a self-taught enthusiastic about these technologies. Germany was a destination where he expanded his knowledge of hardware and software (computer components and programs for them). Already back in his beloved native country, Argentina, after a few years he emigrated to the US looking for stability for his family. He studied and worked as much as he could. With his load of knowledge he was able to defend himself very well in the American market. The distribution of network products with the MLM payment method caught his attention, he immediately knew that the Internet would be the giant of communications and the distribution of network products would be the solution to any economic problem.

					Socorro Trejo (Director and co-founder of NetworkWealthClub LLC, and managing member of the Hector Gonzalo Foundation), An excellent network marketing professional. Aware of her humble origins and that at a very early age she started a family, leaving her childhood lost in the responsibilities of an adult woman. She emigrated to the US from his beloved native Mexico, following his parents. Her mission was always to build; a family where she raised and educated her childrens, worked in factories without ever leaving the learning. The distribution of products on the network caught her attention and she devoted herself to knowing everything. She was awarded prizes for her brilliant performance, which perhaps there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of Americans and immigrants who never got them, she remembers, among others, the prize of knowing Hawaii with full payment. He has accumulated more than 25 years of experience in network marketing with a motto in his north, helping others.
Today our commercial projects have the honor of having her among us; there is no important decision in our companies that is not consulted for her opinion.<br/>
Since she met the CEO of the companies, she has been a fervent supporter of the project that is today COPAGA CLUB, she was very patient so that everything offers transparency, security and a company with long continuity in the market, offering the best and most honest that her extensive network of followers they deserve.
With the mindset of doubling her success around the world, Socorro has proven herself to be a forward-thinking 21st century leader, empowering people to live life without limits. Socorro's heart and business vision is to see poverty destroyed in the lives of many. See the minds and lives of millions changed. See people from all walks of life take advantage of the wealth of knowledge, savings and the life-changing compensation plan that COPAGA CLUB offers. Socorro believes that our lives are determined by the decisions we make and ONE decision could change EVERYTHING.

					Francisco Roldan (Director of Network Wealth Club and managing member of Hector Gonzalo Foundation) An immigrant of Mexican origin, a fervent believer and determined to grow to give his family everything they need. He created himself as a construction professional, from very basic knowledge to being a successful businessman. When he met the CEO of our companies, it's been more than 5 years, he had already been captivated by the distribution of network products and the compensation plans of MLM. Being a traditional marketer, he did not neglect the potential of MLM in network distribution of products. His persistence, patience and education were his guide to learn. It became a pillar of support to carry out our projects. Only some people have the vision that life is a design, everything has to be designed, even happiness.
Today, with more experience, it integrates our business groups with unconditional support without giving up due to the time it takes to do things well.
					<br><br>
					Today, without this person who believes and supports without asking for anything in return, it would not be possible to plan and carry out gigantic projects such as COPAGA CLUB, we embrace all the countries in their local languages. The secret is that being here and now in an early start situation, the visionaries know that the network will inevitably grow to thousands or hundreds of thousands who understand that they will receive their profits immediately and that there is no room for scam of any kind. He invites you to make a change in your lives and have more freedom for what life has value.
Thank you for being part of our group of entrepreneurs.</div></div>

					<h2>National Wealth Center</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>1. What is National Wealth Center (NWC)?<br>National Wealth Center(NWC) is an easy, cost-effective, stable starting point for anyone that is either money-challenged and/or money-motivated to kick start their finances so that they can leverage themselves to higher entry financial vehicles. National Wealth Center is designed so that members can "break-even" with only one sale with our three monthly plans and only two sales with our three one-time payment plans thus lifting the concern of getting started.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>2. What are the products that National Wealth Center has available?<br>National Wealth Center products vary on each of its 7 levels ranging from print, audio and video material. Our core products include personal, business and wealth sections with assorted topics. Products are updated monthly for the three residual monthly plans and with the three one-time payment plans are updated periodically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>3. Can I purchase a course without participating in the reseller opportunity?<br>Absolutely! We invite you to dive into our phenomenal education and empowerment products. Simply pay for the products and that's it. No need to be a reseller and purchase the reseller license if you don't want to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>4. I really like one -time purchase programs. Why is residual income important?<br>Residual income should be the goal of all top marketers. Taking advantage of the compounding that happens each month is what builds security and true wealth. NWC also combines higher dollar amount one-time purchase product levels for the fast "shot-in-the-arm" income. But as you start to develop your customers and team members, you will see that while you do pay monthly, you will have many others that will be paying you monthly which is the whole point behind residual income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>5. Okay – So what’s The cost for this incredible program?<br>It’s hard to believe but the base entry level is really only $25. No strings attached. You also "break-even" with your first sale too! You can join any or all levels available including the residuals or one-time purchases but you can only earn income from the levels you are participating in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>6. How do I pay?<br>You can pay with MasterCard, Visa Credit/Debit Cards, as well as Solid Trust Pay, Western Union, Money Gram and more. The NWC program is peer-to-peer which means the members are selling their own products and thus collect the income from the sale of those products by whatever means they’d like.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>7. Do you have support tools?<br>Absolutely. We are proud of our support tools. Lead capture pages, banners and all sorts of free and premium tools available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>8. Does National Wealth Center have an affiliate program?<br>Yes of course. Our affiliate program is similar in nature to a franchise but without the huge price tag. We allow you to use our platform, sell our products and you keep the money all for a $19.95 per month administration/license fee. That’s it. I know. It sounds crazy simple but it really works. We take care of the people that refer others to the value we bring to the marketplace. Please get back to the person that referred you to NWC. You become a customer and you are instantly a member as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>9. I am not a techie. Do you have training?<br>Absolutely! We have many training videos for each product and much more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>10. Is NWC international?<br>Yes. Since our products are virtual, most countries can use the products. Education is universal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>11. Do you have support?<br>Yes we do. Support is very important. We do live monthly conference calls, email support as well as skype &amp; webinars.  You may also contact us anytime via the contact page. If your matter is urgent someone will get back to you within 24-48 hours during normal business hours. Mon-Fri | 9AM to 5PM EST.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>12. If I ever want to cancel, how can I do that?<br>	We hate to see anyone leave but all you need to do is cancel the admin and member payment subscription(s) you may have. You can do this by contacting the service used to pay or by contacting the NWC member you are paying.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>13. Can I have more than one membership?<br>No. We do not endorse anyone having more than one membership. There is no need for it. Get one position and work it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>14. How can people join if they can not pay using one of the payment options available?<br>They can always use cash, check , money gram etc. Really it’s up to what they and the receiver of the sale of the products will accept. Contact them and work something out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>15. Are there any requirements to get paid?<br>Yes. We have minimal requirements. Through 2 decades online we have come to realize that most people need minimums. If none are in place then many will do the minimum which is nothing. People need to refer 4 to be qualified to receive pass ups on each of the residual levels and only 1 at the one-time plans. If any of the people cancel then they need to be replaced with the next active sale referred. This is for the benefit of all members. We don’t want anyone passing up "dud" sales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>16. Are there any refunds given?<br>We want you to feel comfortable about transacting business with National Wealth Center. Due to the nature of the NWC’s business and the accessibility of our products immediately upon purchase, there are No refunds on the $19.95 admin payment. Concerning the monthly investments, you may  contact the person you paid to begin your membership to ask for a refund. Getting a refund from them is a case-by-case decision and is different with each member. Make sure before you buy that you will give it at least some appropriate time to see whether or not you are a good fit for the NWC Business Opportunity. </p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>17. What is Infinity 100 (ID100) or Infinity Downline (ID) I hear about occasionally?<br>ID and ID100 are the earlier versions of NWC which absorbed, combined and improved upon them. NWC has the same core properties that made them grow in 5 years to 300,000 members plus much more value.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>18. What’s the monthly admin/lease fee all about?<br>NWC gives a complete duplicable platform for everyone to use. We don’t charge a franchise fee or upfront cost. Just buy the products and you can sell them too. We have expenses, new products to load every month, programmers, support and more to have to take care of. You are also obtaining the right to make as much money as you can and all the admin gets is $19.95 a month leasing fee. Great deal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>19. Do I need a website?<br>Having your own website is not a bad idea, however the moment you join you will receive a referral link instantly. This link will be specifically for this website. When people visit the site with your link, your personal "ID" will follow them through the site, page for page all the way to the sign up page. You will be notified and credited for that sign up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
